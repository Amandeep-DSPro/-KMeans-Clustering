# K Means Clustering Project

Overview
In this project, we use KMeans Clustering to group universities into two categories: Private and Public. We analyze various attributes of universities to understand their clustering patterns.

Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)


# Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Exploration:

- Loading the dataset (College_Data.csv).
- Exploring the data using visualizations such as scatterplots and histograms.

2. Data Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values (if any).
- Feature scaling (if required).

3. KMeans Clustering:

- Applying KMeans Clustering algorithm to cluster universities.
- Evaluating the clustering results using confusion matrix and classification report.


4. Conclusion:

Summarizing the findings and model performance.


# Results

The KMeans clustering model performs moderately well in classifying universities into Private and Public categories. However, there is room for improvement in accuracy and precision, as indicated by the confusion matrix and classification report.
